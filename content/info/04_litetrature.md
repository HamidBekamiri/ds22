While this course does not come with a list of mandatory readings, we will often refer to some central resources in R and python, which for the most part can always be accessed in a free and updated online version.  We generally recommend you to use these amazing resources for problem-solving and further self-study on the topic.

## Main Literature

These pieces of work can be seen as main references for data science using R and Python. We will frequently refer to selected chapters for further study.
Documentation of the used packages, tutorials, papers, podcasts etc. will be added throughout.

## Further Ressources

### Data Science Cloud services 

* Notebook bases:
   * [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com): Googles popular service for editing, running & sharing Jupyter notebooks (Only Python Kernel, but R kernel can be accessed via some tricks)
   * [Deepnote](https://deepnote.com): New popular online notebook service with good integration to other services (Python, R & more)
   * [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/): Also provides their own cloud-based service co create and run computational notebooks. Convenient, unlimited, but a bit slow (Pyhton, r ).
* Instance based:
   * [UCloud](https://cloud.sdu.dk): New cloud infrastructure provided by AAU, AU, SDU
   * [AAU Strato](https://strato.claaudia.aau.dk/): AAU CLAUDIA infratructure. Very powerful, but access needs a bit of experience with working via terminal.

### Community

* [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/): Crowdsourced data science challanges. Nowadays also provides a vivid community where you find datasets, notebooks for all kind of data science exercises.
