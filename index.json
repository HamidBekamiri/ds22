Moodle : We will not use it too much, but for the sake of completeness. However, you will still find your calendar there and we may use it from time to time to send out mass-mails to you all. Datacamp : Get access to all the Datacamp premium content for free to facilitate your data science journey. Use your AAU mail here when signing up. Adittional Infrastructure used Github Provides internet hosting for software development and version control using Git. It offers the distributed version control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git, plus its own features. It is also commonly used to host open-source projects, including data science projects. If you do not have it already, you are advice to create an account to manage and showcase your work during this semester. A brief introduction into the main functionalists can be found here.

Particularly, students will learn how to explore, analyze, and visualize natural language (text) as well as relational (network) data.\nM3: Data-Driven Business Modelling and Strategy 15 ECTS Course with integrated project in which you will learn how companies plan, prepare and execute data-driven projects. In the project you will work wich a company case and build a \u0026ldquo;mini\u0026rdquo; version of the product/process.\nFor Social Data Science Students - Elective Semester M3: (SDS) Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence for Analytics 5 ECTS\nIntroduces to the most recent developments in machine learning, which are deep learning and artificial intelligence applications. The module will provide a solid foundation for this exciting and rapidly developing field. Students will learn whether and how to apply deep learning techniques for business analytics, and acquire proficiency in new methods autonomously.\nCapstone Project Semester project utilising techniques and approaches from SDS in the context of a problem related to your main study field.\n"},{"uri":"https://aaubs.github.io/ds22/info/04_litetrature/","title":"Literature &amp; Resources","tags":[],"description":"","content":"While this course does not come with a list of mandatory readings, we will often refer to some central resources in R and python, which for the most part can always be accessed in a free and updated online version.
